Overview of Quizbowl

To run the quizbowl project, start by navigating to the directory containing the project files. Once there you need to only select the file z3_app.py in order to use the quizbowl program. After selecting the app file you will need to follow the on-screen instructions to choose a quiz category by entering the corresponding number for options like "Taxation," "Finance," and more. Once selected, the application will fetch a set number of random questions from the chosen category. Answer each question by entering the option letter (e.g., A, B, C, or D). After completing the quiz, the application will display your score, indicating the number of correctly answered questions out of the total. The project ensures proper resource management by automatically closing the database connection upon completion. If you encounter any issues, review these steps and ensure Python is installed on your system.

Database File

The database file in the quizbowl project serves as a structured storage system for questions and answers, organizing the data into six distinct tables. Each table corresponds to a specific category or topic, offering a well-organized and efficient means of managing the diverse range of quiz content. The database schema is designed to encapsulate information about each question, including its unique identifier, the question text, answer options, and the correct answer. The six different tables within the database represent various subject areas or quiz categories. For instance, the tables are named "Taxation," "Finance," "CostAccounting," "FinancialAccounting," "BusinessAnalytics," and "BusinessAppDev." Each table houses a collection of questions related to its respective category, enabling a targeted and systematic retrieval of questions during the quizbowl application's execution.

Create File

The z1_create.py file functions as a dedicated script for populating the quizbowl database with questions and answers, offering a streamlined and efficient means of managing quiz content. Beginning with the establishment of a connection to the SQLite database through the sqlite3 module, the script organizes the data insertion process into distinct functions, each responsible for populating a specific table corresponding to a quiz category, such as "Taxation," "Finance," and others. Within each function, questions and answers are structured in a convenient format, such as a list of dictionaries, facilitating the insertion process. SQL INSERT statements are employed to systematically inject each question and its corresponding answer options and correct answer into the appropriate table. The structure of the INSERT statements aligns with the predefined schema for each table in the database. Upon completing the data insertion for each category, the script commits the changes to the database, ensuring that the newly added questions are permanently stored. Finally, the script closes the database connection, adhering to best practices for resource management. To execute the population process, users need only run the z1_create.py file using a command such as python z1_create.py. This standalone file simplifies the management of quiz content, providing a clear and efficient means to expand and customize the question database for seamless integration with the quizbowl application.
